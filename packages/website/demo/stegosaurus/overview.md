Use the `'stegosaurus'` template to generate a **table with all the component properties**.

This table is very similar to the table generated by Storybook, with a few differences:

| Feature       | Storybook | Stegosaurus | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | :-------: | :---------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name          |     ✅     |      ✅      | Both in bold in the first column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Description   |     ✅     |      ✅      | Both in the second column as first text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Type          |     ✅     |      ✅      | Both as inline code block in the second column, under the description.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Params        |     ✅     |      ✅      | Both as inline code block in the second column, under the type.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Default value |     ✅     |      ✅      | Both as inline code block in the third column.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Control       |     ✅     |      ❌      | In the storybook the table is integrated with the story of the component. C2M's proposal is that this table can be used anywhere, so it needs to be platform independent.                                                                                  |
| Required      |     ✅     |      ✅      | Both with a red asterisk next to the property name.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Deprecated    |     ❌     |      ✅      | Stegosaurus identifies the [@deprecated](https://tsdoc.org/pages/tags/deprecated/) tag and places an alert icon next to the property name and, if it has description, places the description text as the first paragraph in the second highlighted column. |
| Since         |     ❌     |      ✅      | Stegosaurus identifies the [@since](https://jsdoc.app/tags-since.html) tag and places the version description in the second column.                                                                                                                        |
